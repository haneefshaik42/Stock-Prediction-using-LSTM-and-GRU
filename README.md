# Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM-and-GRU
### Objective
This project aims to predict stock prices for major companies using deep learning models- LSTM (Long Stort-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Units).
These models are well suited for time-series forecasting due to theri ability capture sequential dependencies and trends
